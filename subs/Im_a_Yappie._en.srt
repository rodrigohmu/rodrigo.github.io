00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,340
Hi, I'm Mayuko, and I'm a Yappie.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,020
Now if you haven't heard of this term before, Yappie stands for Young Asian Professional.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,360
We're known to pursue financially comfortable jobs, not take huge risks in life and overall, just play it safe.

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,740
I honestly don't think that it's a bad thing to be a Yappie.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,320
Nor is it probably like a great thing either.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,960
Either way, I think this is the life that my parents and grandparents worked so hard for

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,460
so I like to think that I'm making them proud

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,540
Wait, hold up. But don't they want you to do meaningful work that impacts the lives of others?

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,690
Well, yeah!

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,169
But I'm just kind of doing that through a well-paying job.

11
00:00:40,329 --> 00:00:45,058
But in this day and age, don't need you take risks to do what's right for yourself and your community,

12
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:50,459
even if it compromises your financial independence, because it's just the right thing to do?

13
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:51,100
Well, maybe?

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,460
So here's my story.

15
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,200
From a young age, my parents encouraged me to find a job that's financially stable.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,140
It makes sense.

17
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,780
My parents were immigrants from Japan who didn't have a whole lot to fall back on as they raised me and my brother while they were finishing grad school.

18
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,800
The fear of the unknown. The fear of living as an immigrant in this country where they had no roots,

19
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,500
challenged us and meant that we needed to stay strong to support each other.

20
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:16,199
Not that things ever felt super rough for me growing up.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,839
I was born and raised here, and I spoke English fluently

22
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,260
So I didn't feel much different from the white kid who was sitting next to me.

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,280
It felt like I had a pretty normal childhood.

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,320
Until maybe about high school came around and I thought about cultural identity issues but,

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,940
We'll talk about that in another video.

26
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,000
Anyways, I knew through that my parents struggles, I would have to make it on my own.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,100
So I went to college and studied computer science to become a software engineer.

28
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,600
That was like my goal in life for 21 years.

29
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,530
Go to school. Graduate. And get a job.

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,680
It was a straightforward plan to me, and it was simple.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,470
But it turns out that when you're striving for a milestone and not a mission, you can feel lost when you achieve it.

32
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,379
So, after I got a job and the whole honeymoon period of working 9 to 5 wore off I found myself asking

33
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:03,959
Now what? Was I going to be working 40 hour weeks as a software engineer for the rest of my life?

34
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,570
I mean, sure that sounded ok,

35
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,360
considering I never would have to worry about money again. Was I ever going to do something that was super

36
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,680
out there and risk everything that I had worked so hard to get?

37
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,620
Yeah, nope, there was no way I was giving that up.

38
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,730
but, did I want to find a greater purpose and meaning in life and

39
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:26,280
figure out who I am as a person and what my values are so that I could have a positive impact on the world?

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,360
Well, yeah! Definitely.

41
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,400
But I feel like I was afraid of something. Why couldn't I just do it? What was holding me back?

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,900
Well, it turns out that it's the same fear that kept my family together.

43
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,900
The fear of the unknown.

44
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,880
The uncertainty of

45
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,480
Making it through living in a country that I called home.

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,580
Once I realized this, I realized that every decision of my life was fueled by a strong sense of worry and fear.

47
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,140
I mean like, going to UCSD? because I didn't want to be far away from my family.

48
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,600
What about studying computer science?

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,440
The job prospects were good and I was good at math and science.

50
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,740
Deciding to be a software engineer?

51
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,040
Well, the pay isn't bad.

52
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,600
These decisions were all fueled by my worries. Would my family be okay? Would I have any regrets in life?

53
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,080
Will I be able to spend enough time with my family?

54
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:23,340
But, also these questions make me realize what's important to me and what I want in life.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,360
I think that maybe the emotion of fear was a stronger emotion than anything else and you know

56
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,730
the more that I think about it

57
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:34,160
The more that I think that this way of living is totally okay

58
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,520
and it's okay to keep asking myself these questions frequently.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,660
I mean, I never want to get to a point where I'm not putting myself or my family first

60
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,180
or putting ourselves in danger.

61
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,320
It's just like not part of my nature to do something like that

62
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,839
But it is safe and safe might not get me to the type of life that I want to live.

63
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:56,940
You see my biggest fear in life is dying without having done all the things that I wanted to do in life.

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,200
When I asked myself what those things actually were,

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,060
I found that some of those things were tangible and milestone oriented.

66
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,020
Getting a job, adopting a dog, getting married, having kids

67
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,580
But I also realized that I have some intangible goals too.

68
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,540
Like having an incredible human experience and feeling a wide range of human emotions

69
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,380
and getting to know all kinds of people

70
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,440
and very millenial of me but having a positive impact on the world

71
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,779
very millenial of me but having a positive impact on the world

72
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:27,080
I want to cry about things that I didn't even know I could cry about and

73
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,720
of course, laughing until I cried like a million more times.

74
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,740
And to be honest, I'm at a point in my life

75
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,180
Where a lot of those tangible goals luckily are doable

76
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:42,260
But I honestly have like no idea on how to achieve my intangible goals

77
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:49,160
Honestly, I couldn't even put into words what those goals were until recently because just the uncertainty used to scare me so much

78
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,400
But realizing what I want from life is forcing me to come to terms with the fact that I need to put myself in

79
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,740
challenging and difficult situations, that I wouldn't have put myself in before

80
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,460
and I know that I'm not quite ready to make like big risky moves in life like

81
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,140
I'm still going to make very responsible decisions

82
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,020
Actually, making videos is one way that I'm doing this

83
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,220
And I don't think making videos is necessarily like a safe route

84
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,620
It forces me to look at myself and understand who I am as an individual so that I can positively impact others.

85
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,600
But yeah, I'm still very much a Yappie. And I think there's nothing wrong with that

86
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,260
There's nothing wrong with playing it safe.

87
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,120
You gotta do what you gotta do, but I also feel like it's a waste to not try to understand who you are

88
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,159
Why you are and what you're gonna do about it?

89
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,230
We only have one life on this earth

90
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:45,140
And if you think about the vastness of the universe and how minuscule your life is compared to everything else

91
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:49,780
Then, you have a responsibility to live it so that it felt significant to youâ€”

92
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,780
The person that matters most.
